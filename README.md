# Anomaly-Detection-in-Video-CCTV-Surveillance-

This is a minor project performed in a group of three.

# Overview:

Our project aims at easing the tedious task of going through hours of CCTV footage on a daily basis to find if something unusual happened. This application will be very useful for monitoring and security purposes in housing societies, office/commercial spaces and hostels/PGs. Wardens in hostels wonâ€™t have to go monitor the footage continuously to check for misbehaving students. Our application can be connected directly to the live CCTV footage and detect any unusual/suspicious activities that took place and report it to the administrator. The respective authority can review the details of such events and take the necessary action. The details that can be included in the report are: an alert that some event is flagged, the time it happened; and some still frames/screenshots of the suspicious activity. Now, the wardens of hostels/security guards can simply review those specific activities during the time frame mentioned in the report and act upon it. This will save a ton of precious time and resources.

We propose a deep learning approach to detect real-world anomalies in surveillance videos. Due to the complexity of these realistic anomalies, using only normal data alone may not be optimal for anomaly detection. We attempt to exploit both normal and anomalous videos. To avoid labor-intensive temporal annotations of anomalous segments in training videos, we learn a general model of anomaly detection using deep MIL framework with weakly labeled data. This approach can be used for classification of anomalies in several categories based on the dataset used to train the model. Furthermore, with the relevant dataset, reporting of the such incidents can also be streamlined and detailed using NLP to make this project more user-friendly. Hence, the major limitation faced by us was data constraints, and lack of time and power for the modeling of huge datasets.
